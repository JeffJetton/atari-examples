Confession time: We haven’t been being good 2600 citizens so far. There’s a certain amount of setup we really should be doing at the beginning of our program. Like a trained chef who gets his or her [*mise en place*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place "Wikipedia article on mise en place") arranged before cooking a meal, we have to prepare our virtual working area and make sure everything is in its place.

On an emulator, this isn’t super-important. Typically, the microprocessor and the entire memory map start as a blank slate. But on a real 2600, those registers and addresses could be set to who-knows-what. That can cause trouble down the line. We need to take care of things by doing this:

## Typical Initialization Steps

1. Make sure the chip is ignoring interrupts (even though it probably won’t get any, as discussed earlier).
1. Ensure that the processor is in the normal, binary math mode.
   * The 6502 family can operate in a special "Binary-Coded Decimal" mode that can be quite useful in certain situations.
   * This is not one of those situations. So we *really* want to make sure that BCD mode is off if we want addition and subtraction to behave as expected.
1. Set the “stack pointer” to its highest value. We’ll talk more about this later, but for now, these are the two things to know:
   * The stack pointer marks the *bottom* of a special section of RAM called the "stack". This location can vary as the stack changes in size.
   * Nearly every program you write will **also** be using RAM for storing what are essentially variables.
   * Since we don't want our variables area and the stack area to stomp all over each other, we'd prefer that the stack start out as far out of our way as possible.
1. Set every register in the TIA chip to zero.
1. Set every byte in RAM to zero.

## Basic Set Up

The first part of our program takes care of steps 1-3:

```assembly
; Basic set-up

Start   sei         ; Prevent interrupts
        cld         ; Clear "binary-coded decimal" mode
        ldx #$FF    ; Take the highest address in RAM...
        txs         ; ...and put it in the stack pointer
```

The first two instructions are pretty straightforward. They're both single-byte codes that do one specific task and don't require any value to follow them--akin to a function that takes no arguments:

   * `sei` - **SE**t **I**nterrupt disable
   * `cld` - **CL**ear binary-coded **D**ecimal mode

The next two lines set the stack pointer. In the previous two versions, we used the microprocessor’s A register (aka the Accumulator) as our “clipboard” to transfer a value to a specific place. Here we’re doing basically the same thing, but we're using a different register on the chip: The X register. The instruction itself is almost identical, only it's `ldx` (**L**oa**D** **X**) instead of `lda`.

The X register (along with its sibling, the Y register) is not as full-featured as the primary A register. But you can put things into it, take things out, and increment or decrement it. It works great as an index or counter register, which is what you'll mostly use it for.

But one thing X can do that that A cannot is transfer its contents to the stack pointer (via `txs`: **T**ransfer **X** to the **S**tack pointer). That's why we're using X here instead of A... we don't really have any other choice!

Also notice that we’re not “storing” X in the stack pointer, but rather “transferring” it. And we don't need to specify an address. That’s because the stack pointer is not at an external location--it's a register living right on the microprocessor, just like A, X, and Y. Moving data between local microprocessor registers is, in the jargon of the 6502 instruction set, a *transfer* rather than a *store*.

## Initializing the "Zero-Page"

Due to the way the VCS maps all of its address locations, the various TIA registers, RAM areas, etc. that we need to clear out all happen to be found in the first 256 bytes of addressable space. Lucky for us, this "zero-page" (where a *page*, in this case, is a block of 256 bytes) can be handled very efficiently by the 6502 family.

For our first stab at this, we'll use an approach similar to what you're probably used to in a high-level langauage. (Spoiler alert: We'll rewrite this in the next version.)

The basic steps (for now) are sort of like a FOR loop or a WHILE loop:

1. Keep track of the current address location, starting at address zero.
2. Write a zero to wherever our current address location is.
3. Increment our current address to the next location.
4. Have we gotten to the top (i.e., address $FF)?
   * If so, exit the loop
   * If not, go to step 2

Note that the 6502 registers that we can use to keep track of our current address are only 8-bits in size. So we can't stop our loop when we *exceed* $FF. $FF is the largest value it can hold--we'll never get any higher than that. So we have to stop our loop when we *equal* $FF.

Yes, that means we'll have one last step to do, where we clear out that last address at $FF.

The assembly-language version of these steps looks like this:

```assembly
        ldx #0 
        ldy #0
        
Init    sty  0,x
        inx
        
        txa
        cmp #$FF
        bne  Init
        
        sty $FF
```

We're using the X register as our address pointer. Y just holds the zero that we'll write to the zero-page.

At the beginning of the `Init` loop, we store the contents of Y (which is always zero) to wherever X is pointing. Well, actually we're writing it to address "zero plus X". There is no 6502 assembly instruction that simply stores a value to address X directly. But we can use X as an offset to some constant address. In this case, our constant is zero, so it's effectively a "store Y in address X" instruction when all is said and done.

Next we check to see if we need to exit the loop. There is no "IF" statement in assembly. Like just about everything else in assembly, this simple "IF" logic takes multiple steps:

1. Compare the contents of A to some value
1. Do something based on what the results of that comparison were

So that's what we do. We can't do a comparison on the X register--only the A register. So we first have to **T**ransfer **X** to **A**.

Then we execute our comparison. This doesn't change any normal register contents, but it does set some "flags" (think of them as boolean variables) on the chip. These flags keep track of whether the most-recent math operation resulted in a zero, or in a negative number, or caused a mathematical "carry" to occur, and so on.

Finally, we check the result of the comparison (by looking at whatever flags are now set) and act accordingly. In this case, we do a **B**ranch if the previous comparison found that the two values were **N**ot **E**qual. That keeps our loop running until X equals $FF.

We wrap up with one last store of Y into the highest address of the zero-page (since the loop would've missed it).

> **Note:** The comparison is actually a subtraction that throws away the result. If the values being compared (the contents of A and whatever value is being used as an argument to the `cmp` instruction) are equal, then the subtraction operation results in a zero, which flips on the zero flag. If the values are different, the subtraction will *not* result in a zero (thus turning *off* the zero flag) but might do other things such as set the negative flag or the carry flag.

The instructions in this init routine take up 14 bytes of ROM and take over 3,000 cycles to execute. Not bad--but **we can do better!** Stay tuned...



## Review

* It's (usually) a good idea to start your VCS programs by initializing the system and clearing out the TIA and RAM.
* In addition to the Accumulator, the registers on the 6502-family microprocessors include X, Y, and SP (the stack pointer).
* "Branching" is the assembly-language equivalent of a conditional ("if") statement. It relies on previous operations setting various "flags".

Next, we'll re-write that zero-page loop to a more efficient form that's more idiomatic to assembly language.
